## 🧘🏾‍♀️ Why It Matters

> Representation matters — not just in who builds tech, but in how it speaks back to us.

SageSpeak’s isn’t just another app. It’s a **tool of healing, reflection, and empowerment**, designed by and for the community. It meets people where they are — spiritually, culturally, and emotionally — and guides them forward.
